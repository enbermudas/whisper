# whisper

Twitter/Threads like app made with Svelte, love and powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

This is quite a simple project made with the purpose of testing Svelte.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Goals

- [x] Build basic "tweet" functionality.
- [x] Implement [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for easier styling.
- [x] Create integration tests using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
